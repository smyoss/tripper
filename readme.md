<h1>Tripper</h1>
<h2>Making Organizing and Planning Trips Easy and Efficient </h2>

<p>This application will be used to assist with planning roadtrips and vacations. This is mostly a learning project for me. I'm attempting to learn Node.js a bit better as well as better design of REST APIs. Hopefully, this project will turn into a pretty cool utility to plan road trips, weekends away, etc. </p>

<p>This project will be used to store information about:
<ul>
<li> Travel Locations</li>
<li>Equipment & Maintence</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Shopping</li></ul>
</p>

<h4>Please stay tuned! Thanks. </h4>
